While this plugin doesn't symbolize the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation, it does remove the ability to upload a custom header image.

== Description ==

Do you run a blog network where you want to offer the ability to use custom headers, taking advantage of all the features for custom headers introduced in 3.0, but without the ability to have users upload there own images?  Now is your chance.

Great for allowing your choice of branded header images.

== Installation ==

For an automatic installation through WordPress:

1. Go to the 'Add New' plugins screen in your WordPress admin area
1. Search for 'Remove Custom Header Uploads'
1. Click 'Install Now' and activate the plugin

Or use a nifty tool by WordPress lead developer Mark Jaquith:

1. Visit [this link](http://coveredwebservices.com/wp-plugin-install/?plugin=remove-custom-header-uploads) and follow the instructions.

For a manual installation via FTP:

1. Upload `remove-custom-header-uploads.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in your WordPress admin area

To upload the plugin through WordPress, instead of FTP:

1. Upload the downloaded zip file on the 'Add New' plugins screen (see the 'Upload' tab) in your WordPress admin area and activate.

For all methods, you should end it by sitting back and enjoy a glass of whisky
