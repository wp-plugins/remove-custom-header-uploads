While this plugin doesn't symbolize the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation, it does remove the ability to upload a custom header image.

== Description ==

Do you run a blog network where you want to offer the ability to use custom headers, taking advantage of all the features for custom headers introduced in 3.0, but without the ability to have users upload there own images?  Now is your chance.

Great for allowing your choice of branded header images.
